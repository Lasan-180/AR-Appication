# AR Application

This is an augmented reality (AR) application aimed at children to help them learn about geometrical shapes. The application utilizes AR.js and A-Frame libraries to create an interactive and immersive learning experience.

## Features

- Marker-based AR: The application uses marker-based AR technology to detect predefined markers and display 3D geometrical shapes on top of them.

- Geometrical Shapes: The application includes three basic geometrical shapes - cubes, spheres, and pyramids. Each shape is represented by a 3D model that can be interacted with in the AR scene.

- Gesture Handling: The application provides gesture handling functionality, allowing users to rotate and scale the objects using intuitive gestures.

- Shape Selection: The application includes buttons that allow users to change the geometrical shape being displayed in the AR scene. This provides flexibility for children to explore different shapes and learn their properties.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
-git clone https://github.com/Lasan-180/AR-Appication.git


2. Serve the application:
- Host the application on a web server or locally serve it to view the AR scene in a web browser that supports WebXR. You can use tools like Python's SimpleHTTPServer or VSCode Live Server extension for local serving.

3. Open the application:
- Open a web browser that supports WebXR (e.g., Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).
- Enter the URL where the application is hosted to access the AR scene.
